  i need to dicuss further on this question not getting how to acheive this 
  
  1-i am thinking to write a java code to execute on the server and get all the meta data and then using json parsor we can query the json out from meta data service imdv2

2- second approach is to if we need some specific data for example public ip or private of the server also the centralize setup to this use case so we can use the AWS config service to achieve this use case from aws org point of view
